<h1>The Best Movies According to Link</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2> 

<hr />

<h3>1. Guardians of the Galaxy 3</h3>
<p>I love Rocket Raccoon and he was one of the main focuses of this movie, the drama between the rest of the crew makes for a good movie as well and it can get very emotional.</p>

<h3>2. Redline</h3>
<p>Who doesn't love racing super fast cars and trying to pick up chicks? Redline rocks and the animation is mind blowing.</p>

<h3>3. Five Nights At Freddy's </h3>
<p>It may not be the perfect story writing but its a master piece to me gosh darnit. Those silly looking animationics hold a special place in my heart its a fun movie. </p>
